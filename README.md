# Scanning-NGS-datasets-for-mitochondrial-and-coronavirus-contaminants

The analysis identifies contaminating mitochondrial reads in NGS datasets, and can also be adapted to identify contaminating coronavirus reads

A description can be found in 'complete-mapping-workflow.txt'

The analysis runs on Linux (aarch64/x86-64)

A bash script mitoscan.sh automates the mitochondrial genome mapping workflow

Output of mitocan analyses of various NGS datasets can be found in files 'Mito-mappings...'
